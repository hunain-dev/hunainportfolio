    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h4>{`Hi! I'm Muhammad Hunain, a Web Designer and Web Developer from Karachi, Pakistan. I specialize in creating interactive, visually appealing websites using ReactJS, GSAP, Framer Motion, and other modern technologies.

With a focus on front-end development, I design sleek, user-friendly websites that are not only functional but also deliver seamless digital experiences. I love adding animations and smooth transitions to my projects, making them stand out.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects, including those featured on Awwwards, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and innovate in the world of web development.

Feel free to explore my work and connect if you'd like to collaborate!`}</h4>
